# WebSite_social_network

> A social network in php

## Objetive

I had to design a social network. All users must be able to post a text or an image or a comment associated with an image or text already posted. It must also be possible to "Like" a text, an image or a comment already posted.

## How

- First I had to design the client interface of the social network and allow the addition of a text or image post in the social network. So I created a web page in HTML/CSS which contains one or more forms allowing the user to make posts. I wrote functions in PHP to make the posts, that is to say to store files containing the posts in a folder shared by all the students. Then I used the tools provided by my browser to visualize each type of post and the content of HTTP requests/responses.

- For the second part of the project, I wrote the programs which allow the display of posts according to the choices made by the user of the social network. As well as programs that allow you to add comments and manage likes.
